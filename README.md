Test Yourself: Backgrounds and Borders 1

In this task we want you to add a background, border, and some simple styling to a page header:

1. Give the box a 5px black solid border, with rounded corners of 10px.
2. Add a background image (use the URL balloons.jpg) and size it so that it covers the box.
3. Give the &lt;h2&gt; a semi-transparent black background color, and make the text white.
